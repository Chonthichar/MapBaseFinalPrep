# MapBaseFinalPrep

Final exam expectations 

Objective : Create a functional, beautiful, and meaningful web application


### To Get a D understand the basic: 
* Do exactly like what was shown in the class.
* Make sure basic functionality and deployment are like taught in the class.
* Map not show on github but just code that was deployed.
	
### To C and B: 
* Make the app fun and useful - might get C if do like an assignment
* Use many layers for example like when we deploy community,  school or emergency services., shelter, military. 
* Add new data sets  we havenâ€™t seen before.
* Make the app interactive : month  zoom in, hover, move things, draw things, clustering, zooming
* Shows different kinds of information like shapes and lines, with many point layers and many types of interactivity.

### To impress an get an A Scalability and structure: 
* Add in important functionalities, using open layer like : 
    * Measurement tools : https://openlayers.org/en/latest/examples/measure.html
    * Drawing and modifying features : Draw and modify examples. 
https://openlayers.org/en/latest/examples/draw-and-modify-features.html 
* Have a lot of interactive parts.
* Features that move with the mouse or autonomously (flight attackers, routing for travel directions)
* Your app should work well and look good - styling, function icons, polygons and customizing features.
* Use husky and prettier for nicer code, make it look neat.
* Code functionality will be the main grading criterion, not how nice the app is. 
* Poorly formatted code will not result in failure but will negatively impact the grade.
* Make sure the app is online on Github.
* Included at least two background layers and map stability.

### Extra tips: 
* Use different map views, from above or the side. 
Include live data
* Vector Layers: Show real places like houses or areas on your map.
* Tile Layers: Make sure the map itself looks right.
* Map Projections: Set up your map so it shows the world correctly.
* Interactive Features: Let users move stuff around on the map.
* Shapes: Use different shapes to show information on the map.
